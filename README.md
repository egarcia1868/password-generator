# Random Password Generator

This is my random password generator.  It will generate a 8 - 128 digit, randomized password using lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers.

## Getting Started

To run the password generator, just bring up the html page, click on the generate password button, answer the alerts that popup, and the process will be complete.

### Prerequisites

The only thing you really need to run this, is an internet browser.
